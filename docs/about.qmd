`easytranscriber` draws heavy inspiration from [`WhisperX`](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) [(Bain et al., 2023)](https://www.isca-archive.org/interspeech_2023/bain23_interspeech.pdf).

The forced alignment component is based on Pytorch's forced alignment API, which implements a GPU-accelerated version of the Viterbi algorithm as described in [Pratap et al., 2024](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume25/23-1318/23-1318.pdf#page=8). 

LibriVox audiobooks in the public domain are used as examples in the `easytranscriber` tutorials.
