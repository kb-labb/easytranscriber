We present throughput comparisons between `easytranscriber` and `WhisperX`. See the [github repository](https://github.com/kb-labb/easytranscriber/tree/main/benchmarks) for more details, and inference code.  

In general, `easytranscriber` achieves a bigger boost on hardware that feature slower single-core CPU performance. The CPU increasingly acts as a bottleneck due to the sequential nature of data loading and forced alignment in `WhisperX`.
