We present throughput comparisons between `easytranscriber` and `WhisperX`. See the [github repository](https://github.com/kb-labb/easytranscriber/tree/main/benchmarks) for details, and inference code.  

In general, `easytranscriber` achieves a greater speedup on hardware with slower single-core CPU performance. The CPU bottlenecks performance in `WhisperX` due to the library's use of sequential data loading, along with its  CPU-based single-threaded forced alignment implementation.
